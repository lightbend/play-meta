# Play Meta

This repository is dedicated to team management, high-level feature discussions and for persisting design decisions.

The intended process is to open an issue about a topic that needs to be discussed and after a conclusion has been reached a PR should be opened that adds a markdown file containing the essence of what has been concluded and why. This PR will then be compared with the issueâ€™s conclusion and merged if it properly reflects the result of the discussion.
